# PlayerGenderOverride (WH40K: Rogue Trader)

While the base game allows you to set your character's voice independently of 
their body type, your character's gender is determined based on your chosen
body type (I = male, II = female).
With this mod, you can override this behaviour.

When active, the game will treat your character as the chosen gender. This
affects:
- Dialogue text (titles, pronouns, etc.)
- Spoken audio (as above)
- Gender-locked quests (romance). These may break if you change gender mid-quest.

Unlike changing your character's gender with eg. Toybox, this does not affect
animations or character model, so those will not break.

In addition, when active, you may optionally override each individual term
(text only).

All settings are per-save, but this mod should not create a save dependency.
